# Hi there! 👋

I'm Christian J. Tai Udovicic (he/him), a planetary data scientist who's passionate about open source software development.

## About Me

I'm a Canadian 🇨🇦 based in Honolulu, HI 🌴 and I focus on developing open-source tools and resources to advance planetary science research. My work aims to enhance the accessibility and reproducibility of scientific analyses and I also volunteer as a board member of [OpenPlanetary](openplanetary.org).

## Some Projects

### [Craterpy](https://github.com/cjtu/craterpy)

🕳️🥧 Craterpy is a Python library designed to simplify the extraction and statistical analysis of impact crater regions in planetary datasets. It facilitates working with crater data tables, extracting associated data, and addresses common challenges in planetary GIS analysis. [Learn more](https://github.com/cjtu/craterpy)

### [MoonPIES: Moon Polar Ice and Ejecta Stratigraphy](https://github.com/cjtu/moonpies)

🌙🥧 MoonPIES models ice and ejecta at depth below lunar polar cold traps. With the imminent return of humans to the Moon through the NASA Artemis program, models like this will inform future exploration for water ice and other lunar resources. [Learn more](https://github.com/cjtu/moonpies)
