# Hi I'm Christian J. Tai Udovicic (he/him) 👋

## About Me

🪐 I'm a planetary (data) scientist who's passionate about open source software development.

🍁 I'm a Canadian based in 🌈🌴 Honolulu, HI where I work on lunar remote sensing, modeling, and developing open-source tools to advance planetary science research. 

🌟 I also volunteer as a board member of [OpenPlanetary](openplanetary.org) where I help connect folks from around the world who are interested in open approaches to planetary science.

## Project Highlights

### [Craterpy](https://github.com/cjtu/craterpy)

🕳️🥧 Craterpy is a Python library designed to simplify the extraction and statistical analysis of impact crater regions in planetary datasets. It facilitates working with crater data tables, extracting associated data, and addresses common challenges in planetary GIS analysis. [Learn more](https://github.com/cjtu/craterpy)

### [MoonPIES: Moon Polar Ice and Ejecta Stratigraphy](https://github.com/cjtu/moonpies)

🌙🥧 MoonPIES models ice and ejecta at depth below lunar polar cold traps. With the imminent return of humans to the Moon through the NASA Artemis program, models like this will inform future exploration for water ice and other lunar resources. [Learn more](https://github.com/cjtu/moonpies)

### [SPIRL: Scientific Programming In Real Life](https://cjtu.github.io/spirl)

😵‍💫🌠 SPIRL is an online JupyterBook textbook I wrote to teach a short course about using version control and python as a scientist. It's been a few years since I ran the full course, but all the interactive tutorials are still freely available on the SPIRL website. [Learn more](https://cjtu.github.io/spirl)
